/**
 * Jest Configuration - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * This configuration file has been deprecated and moved to tests/jest.config.js
 * 
 * Reason for deprecation:
 * - Having multiple Jest config files was causing conflicts
 * - Centralized test configuration in tests/ directory provides better organization
 * - Main config file in tests/jest.config.js handles all test-related settings
 * 
 * Current setup:
 * - Primary Jest config: tests/jest.config.js
 * - Test files: Located in tests/ directory
 * - This file: Kept for reference but not loaded by Jest
 * 
 * If you need to modify Jest settings, edit tests/jest.config.js instead.
