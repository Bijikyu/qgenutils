## Agent Development Guidelines (from 00-AGENTS.md)

### CLI Tools & Operations
Use these CLI tools for analysis and planning:
```bash
# AGENTSQRIPTS - Code analysis tools
npx analyze-static-bugs ./      # Detect bug code smells
npx analyze-security ./         # Security vulnerability scan
npx analyze-wet-code ./         # Find duplicate code
npx analyze-performance ./      # Performance bottleneck detection
npx analyze-srp ./             # Check single responsibility violations

# ARQITECT - Planning and problem solving
npx arqitect "Any prompt to fix a code problem"  # Returns detailed plan
npx arqitect --help                              # Show usage

# QUANTUMAGENT - Reasoning and analysis
node node_modules/quantumagent/.bin/cli.js --task "Reasoner: analyze X" --input ./file.txt
```

### Development Policies
- **Sources of Truth**: external API docs > backend code > frontend code > readmes
- **Response Philosophy**: Truth and functionality above all - prefer errors over lies
- **No Mock Data**: Use authentic data only, no fallbacks or defaults that pretend functionality
- **Subagent Integration**: For complex tasks, spawn 3-6 specialized subagents using quantumagent
- **Always Start with Planning**: Use arqitect for initial planning before implementation

### Code Standards
- Always add comprehensive error handling as seen in existing functions
- Always comment all code with explanation & rationale  
- Follow security best practices in all implementations
- Implement tests for all new functionality
- Write performant, DRY, and secure code prepared for scaling

### Error Handling
- Use qerrors module for error logging: `qerrors(error, 'context', {params})`
- Include error types in JSDoc `@throws` declarations
- Implement comprehensive try/catch blocks with structured error reporting

## JavaScript/NPM Stack Rules (from 01-STACK_RULES.md)

### Testing Standards
- Use qtests module for all testing
- Integration tests in `/tests/` folder at root
- Unit tests co-located with source files
- Run tests with: `npm test` or `qtests-runner.js`
- Include test-to-function mapping comments: `// ðŸ”— Tests: funcA â†’ funcB â†’ funcC`

### Code Writing Standards
- Template literals with backticks (`) for all strings unless technical reason otherwise
- camelCase naming that describes purpose and reveals intent
- Module exports at bottom of file, separate from function definitions
- Use axios over node fetch, isomorphic-git over simple-git
- Never implement jQuery or p-limit

### Dependency Management
- Use existing module dependencies rather than duplicating functionality
- Keep code DRY and lean by leveraging npm modules
- No file duplication for ES/CommonJS compatibility - use smart fixes

## Architecture Patterns (from 02-NPM_architecture.md)

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **One function per file** - changes only touch one file
- **Clear naming** with minimal imports/exports
- **Singular public interface** with tight dependencies
- **Simpler testing** - one test per file
- **Lower coupling** - changes don't ripple across modules
- **AI-friendly** - LLMs load only needed code, reducing tokens
- **Parallel editing** - avoids merge conflicts

### Global Constants Management
- All constants in `/config/localVars.js` as single source of truth
- Group by category, don't move or re-categorize existing values
- Export environment variables: `export const envVar = process.env.ENV_VAR`
- Import entire object: `const localVars = require('../config/localVars')`
- Use as: `localVars.variable` (not destructured imports)
- Never edit constants once in localVars.js
- Flag unused with comment "REMOVE?" but don't delete

## Overview
QGenUtils is a security-first Node.js utility library designed as a lightweight alternative to larger libraries. It provides essential functionalities like authentication, HTTP operations, URL processing, validation, datetime formatting, and template rendering. Its core purpose is to offer robust, fail-closed security patterns and consistent error handling across various utilities, aiming for maximum maintainability, testability, and code clarity.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Replit agent is mainly used for MVP & some bug fixes & testing.
YOU ARE NEVER TO DELETE ANYTHING WITHOUT PERMISSION. DO NOT ASSUME I WANT SOMETHING DELETED, ASK FOR CLARITY.

## Recent Changes
- January 2025: Removed `lib/client/` directory and associated utilities (renderView, makeCopyFn) as functionality moved elsewhere
- Library reorganized from individual category folders to superset groupings for better organization
- Flattened `lib/validation/` structure - moved all validation files directly into validation directory (removed subfolders)
- Moved unit tests to be co-located with source files instead of centralized `tests/unit/` directory
- Improved internal consistency: Updated utilities to use their own validation functions (`isValidString`, `isValidObject`) instead of manual type checks
- **August 19, 2025**: Enhanced self-usage of utilities within the module:
  - Created shared `isValidDate` utility in `lib/validation/isValidDate.js` to eliminate code duplication
  - Updated all datetime utilities (`formatDateTime`, `formatDate`, `formatDuration`, `formatDateWithPrefix`) to use shared `isValidDate` instead of duplicate implementations
  - Fixed manual type checking in `requireFields.js` to use `isValidObject` utility consistently
  - Added `isValidDate` to main exports in `index.js` for external use
  - Created comprehensive test suite for `isValidDate` utility

## System Architecture
QGenUtils follows the comprehensive architecture patterns from 02-NPM_architecture.md, built on pure Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) where each function resides in its own file. Key design principles include:

### Core Architecture Principles (SRP Implementation)
- **One Function Per File**: Each file encapsulates one concrete responsibility
- **Minimal Imports/Exports**: Singular public interface with tight dependencies  
- **Clear Naming**: Functions and variables describe their use and reveal purpose
- **Lower Coupling**: Changes in one function never ripple to others
- **AI-Friendly**: LLMs load only 30 lines needed, not 500-line blobs
- **Parallel Development**: Enables LLM editing without merge conflicts

### Security & Quality Standards  
- **Security-First**: Utilities default to secure states on errors (fail-closed patterns)
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Structured logging via `qerrors` with graceful degradation
- **Performance Optimization**: Lightweight implementation with async operations
- **Testing Integration**: Uses qtests module with co-located unit tests

### Directory Structure
Organized with a `lib/` directory using superset categories following SRP:
  - `validation/` - All validation-related utilities (flattened structure)
  - `utilities/` (string/, file/, url/, datetime/, id-generation/) - General-purpose utility functions
  - `system/` (env/, shutdown/, worker-pool/, realtime/) - System and infrastructure management
  - `security/` (auth/) - Authentication and security utilities
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Not applicable as this is a backend utility library.
- **Technical Implementations**: Node.js based, leveraging SRP for maintainability.
- **Feature Specifications**:
    - **Authentication**: Passport.js integration, fail-closed.

    - **URL Processing**: Normalization, protocol enforcement (defaults to HTTPS), parsing.
    - **Validation System**: Fail-fast, field presence validation with standardized error responses.
    - **DateTime Utilities**: Locale-aware formatting, duration, business date arithmetic; returns "N/A" for invalid dates.
    - **Environment Utilities**: Environment variable validation and configuration checking; fail-fast at startup.
    - **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io broadcast registries, dependency injection for circular dependency prevention.

    - **ID Generation**: Cryptographically secure identifier creation using `nanoid`.
    - **String Sanitization**: Security-first string processing, XSS prevention, fail-closed.
    - **GitHub Validation**: Strict GitHub repository URL validation.
    - **Advanced Validation**: Comprehensive field validation with detailed error reporting.
    - **File Utilities**: File size formatting, input validation.
    - **Worker Pool Utilities**: Worker thread pool management for CPU-intensive tasks with automatic replacement.
    - **Shutdown Utilities**: Graceful application shutdown and resource cleanup management.
- **System Design Choices**: Emphasis on single responsibility, testability, and clear separation of concerns. Error handling pipeline includes logging via `qerrors`, graceful degradation, and generic error messages for users.
