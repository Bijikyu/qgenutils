# Comprehensive Compliance Implementation Plan

## CURRENT STATUS: IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Created `/config/localVars.js` with centralized constants
- ✅ Added test mapping comments to multiple test files
- ⚠️ String literal conversions causing LSP errors - need careful implementation
- ⚠️ Environment variable refactoring in progress

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:

1. **Fix LSP Errors** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Fix corrupted quote conversions in validateEmail.js and other files
   - Restore files to working state before applying systematic changes

2. **Complete 02-NPM_architecture.md Compliance**
   - Refactor all direct process.env usage to use localVars
   - Convert remaining files to use centralized constants
   - Split any remaining multi-function files

3. **Complete 01-STACK_RULES.md Compliance**
   - Carefully convert single quotes to backticks (avoiding regex patterns)
   - Add remaining test mapping comments
   - Enhance JSDoc coverage where needed

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

### Phase 1: Stabilization
- Fix all LSP errors to restore working state
- Test all core functionality

### Phase 2: Architecture Compliance
- Systematic localVars integration
- Environment variable centralization  
- Multi-function file splitting

### Phase 3: Style Compliance
- Careful string literal conversion (excluding regex/special cases)
- Complete test mapping documentation
- JSDoc enhancements

## TARGET OUTCOME:
- 02-NPM_architecture.md: 95%+ compliance
- 01-STACK_RULES.md: 90%+ compliance  
- Zero LSP errors
- All tests passing
- Comprehensive documentation
