✅ **Size Limits**: Comprehensive bounds prevent resource exhaustion
✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal patterns throughout codebase

### **Non-Blocking Architecture**
✅ **Async I/O Operations**: All synchronous operations eliminated
✅ **Event Loop Preservation**: No blocking operations in request paths
✅ **Worker Thread Utilization**: Heavy operations moved to background threads
✅ **Stream Processing**: Non-blocking data handling for large payloads

### **Algorithmic Optimizations**
✅ **O(n²) → O(log n)**: Route matching with binary search optimization
✅ **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations for databases and logging
✅ **Circuit Breaking**: Failure isolation and automatic recovery
✅ **Connection Pooling**: Resource lifecycle management with aging

### **Enterprise Patterns**
✅ **Bounded Collections**: Prevent memory leaks with automatic eviction
✅ **Resource Management**: Comprehensive timer and connection cleanup
✅ **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation and failure isolation
